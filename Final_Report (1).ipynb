    "Horror films have been a staple of cinema since the first horror movie “Le Manoir du Diable” or, in English, “The House of the Devil” directed by the French director Georges Méliès in 1896. Since then, the genre has experienced ups and downs throughout the decade and has exploded into a plethora of subgenres like the slasher, the demonic possession film, the paranormal, among many, many others. Until recently, horror films have largely been dismissed by the academic community as drivel. However, a recent revival in the horror genre has led many academics to look more critically at the horror films of the past in a more scholarly light. Kendall Phillips book “Projected Fears: Horror Films and American Culture” offers a strong thesis on why horror films are worthy of the academic spotlight when discussing American culture. He says, “…while any given film can be frightening to any given individual, certain films become the touchstone of fear for an entire generation. It is as if, at certain points, a particular film so captures our cultural anxieties and concerns that our collective fears seem projected onto the screen before us.” (Phillips). <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Phillips touches on an interesting point about certain films that transcend their genre and strike fear into an entire generation. While Phillips posits this generational fear, this paper is interested in seeing if those fears can be seen in text analysis and perhaps even if there are certain films from a generation they are noticeable across all generations. This question of fear over time is not completely novel as can be seen through John Kenneth Muir’s scholarly book series which investigates horror films by decade. While the majority of this project looks at seminal horror films from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s as a whole, there are points when a finer examination is conducted into each of these generations."

    "The corpus used for this project was titled “Film Corpus 2.0” and was obtained from the Baskin Engineering Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz. The corpus contains the complete text files for 1068 films. The .txt files were originally obtained by the authors in 2015 by scraping files from imdsb.com, a film script database. The original corpus contains 149 horror film scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "37 horror films were chosen for this analysis. These 37 films were chosen for several reasons. Primarily, they used conventional scene slug lines such as INT or EXT or MONTAGE to denote scene changes. Scene changes were a crucial delimiter in my analysis and were used to divide screenplays similar to how chapters divide novels. The screenplay also had to have a reasonable number of scenes to be chosen for analysis. A screenplay needed to have a minimum of 50 scenes for this analysis. 50 scenes was an arbitrary cutoff. The average film in this corpus has 153 scenes and an average of 22,654 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also chose these 37 films because they were all from the three decades analyzed in this paper. The three decades analyzed in this paper are the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s. Films released between 1980-1989 were placed in the 1980s category, films released between 1990-1999 were placed in the 1990s category, and films released between 2000-2010 were placed in the 2000s category. Two films from 2010, Insidious and Legion, were present in my corpus and were placed in the 2000s decade for use in this analysis. There are 8 films in the 1980 category, 10 films in the 1990 category, and 19 films in the 2000s category.\n",
